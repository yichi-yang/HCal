DESCRIPTION:Answer the following questions. For questions asking for short 
 answers\, there may not necessarily be a "right" answer\, although some an
 swers may be more compelling and/or much easier to justify. But I am inter
 ested in your explanation (the "why") as much as the answer itself. Also\,
  do not use shorthand: write your answers using complete sentences.\n\n*\n
 \n* (GMS Design) In the GMS paper\, only ”clean” pages are written to
  global memory (“dirty” pages must be written to disk before they can 
 participate in the GMS pool).\n\n \n\n* Why did GMS chose this restrictio
 n? What problem does it solve?\n\n* Describe how you might change GMS to s
 afely allow it to write dirty pages to the global memory.\n\n* Why does GM
 S require trusted nodes? What risks would be exposed by an untrusted node?
 \n\n* Describe how you might change GMS to work with untrusted nodes?\n\n
  \n\n* (Transparency vs Optimization) Butler Lampson once gave a set of 
 principles for system design. Among these\, he gave two conflicting pieces
  of advice on the nature of implementations. He said\,\n\n“Keep secrets 
 of the implementation. Secrets are assumptions about an implementation tha
 t client programs are not allowed to make... Obviously\, it is easier to p
 rogram and modify a system if its parts make fewer assumptions about each 
 other.”\n\nAnd yet\,\n\n“One way to improve performance is to increase
  the number of assumptions that one part of a system makes about another\;
  the additional assumptions often allow less work to be done\, sometimes a
  lot less.”\n\nThat is\, on the one hand we should hide an implementatio
 n for ease of development (transparency)\, and\, on the other\, we should 
 expose our implementations for speed (optimization). Consider this issue f
 or each of the following three systems – Sprite\, Xen\, Grapevine. For e
 ach System\n\n \n\n* Which advice of Lampson’s did the authors follow? 
 Describe the service that was implemented\, and whether the authors chose 
 to hide or expose in the implementation.\n\n* Describe what was hidden or 
 exposed in the implementation\, and the software mechanisms that were used
  to do the hiding or exposing. Be specific.\n\n* Give a concrete example o
 f how the mechanisms above were used to hide or expose in the system.\n\n*
  Describe one problem the authors had in utilizing their mechanism for the
 ir respective purpose\, and how the authors dealt with that problem. Be sp
 ecific.\n\n* Given the quotes above\, discuss the authors’ goals in foll
 owing the design principle they chose. Did they achieve them? Justify your
  answer.\n\n* (Lazy Evaluation) When implementing some service a common t
 radeoff is between “eager evaluation” — performing an action immedia
 tely when it is requested (hoping to amortize that cost against future acc
 esses) and “lazy evaluation” — deferring the requested action until 
 some later point in time (assuming that it will cost less or may not need 
 to be done in the future). What choice to make depends both on the cost of
  the operation and the expected workload.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n* For each of 
 the following systems\, identify an important operation that uses eager or
  lazy evaluation as an optimization.\n\n* Explain what the operation is an
 d what the required semantics are for it to be correct.\n\n* Describe how 
 the implementation is eager or lazy (including any mechanisms used to ensu
 re correctness) and why this is expected to provide an optimization in the
  common case.\n\n* Finally\, describe a workload scenario in which this im
 plementation will not be an optimization.\n\n3.1 Mach\n3.2 Exokernel\n3.3

 bsp\;</span>Butler Lampson once gave a set of principles for system design
 . Among these\, he gave two conflicting pieces of advice on the nature of 
 implementations. He said\,\n<blockquote>“Keep secrets of the implementat
 ion. Secrets are assumptions about an implementation that client programs 
 are not allowed to make... Obviously\, it is easier to program and modify 
 a system if its parts make fewer assumptions about each other.”</blockqu
 ote>\nAnd yet\,\n<blockquote>“One way to improve performance is to incre
 ase the number of assumptions that one part of a system makes about anothe
 r\; the additional assumptions often allow less work to be done\, sometime
 s a lot less.”</blockquote>\nThat is\, on the one hand we should hide an
  implementation for ease of development (transparency)\, and\, on the othe
 r\, we should expose our implementations for speed (optimization). Conside
 r this issue for each of the following three systems – Sprite\, Xen\, Gr
 apevine. For each System\n<p>&nbsp\;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which advice of Lampso
 n’s did the authors follow? Describe the service that was implemented\,

  software mechanisms that were used to do the hiding or exposing. Be speci

 mplementing some service a common tradeoff is between “eager evaluation
 ” — performing an action immediately when it is requested (hoping to a
 mortize that cost against future accesses) and “lazy evaluation” — d
 eferring the requested action until some later point in time (assuming tha
 t it will cost less or may not need to be done in the future). What choice

DESCRIPTION:Answer the following questions. For questions asking for short 
 answers\, there may not necessarily be a "right" answer\, although some an
 swers may be more compelling and/or much easier to justify. But I am inter
 ested in your explanation (the "why") as much as the answer itself. Also\,
  do not use shorthand: write your answers using complete sentences.\n\n* (
 Scheduler Activations) The Scheduler Activations paper states that deadlo
 ck is potentially an issue when activations perform an upcall:\n\n \n\n
 “One issue we have not yet addressed is that a user-level thread could b
 e executing in a critical section at the instant when it is blocked or pre
 empted...[a] possible ill effect ... [is] deadlock (e.g.\, the preempted t
 hread could be holding a lock on the user-level thread ready list\; if so\
 , deadlock would occur if the upcall attempted to place the preempted thre
 ad onto the ready list). (p. 102)”\n\n \n\nWhy is this not a concern wi
 th standard kernel threads\, i.e.\, why do scheduler activations have to w
 orry about this deadlock issue\, but standard kernel threads implementatio
 ns do not have to?\n\n \n\n* (LFS) The LFS paper is strongly motivated b
 y perceived trends in both hardware performance and user access patterns. 
 Thus\, its improved performance is driven by a set of underlying assumptio
 ns.\n\n \n\n* Explain what are the assumptions about hardware and access 
 patterns that LFS depends on?\n\n* Explain which mechanisms in LFS depend 
 on each assumption?\n\n \n\nFor the purposes of the following questions\,
  NVRAM is persistent storage (i.e.\, will survive the loss of power) and h
 as access times and throughput similar to DRAM.\n\n* At the time the LFS p
 aper was written\, non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) was not commonly available. If
  disks were replaced with NVRAM entirely\, would the LFS design still make
  sense? Explain why or why not and be specific in justifying your answer.\
 n\n* In real-life the cost per byte of disk is likely to be far cheaper th
 an NVRAM for some time. So instead\, consider a situation where some NVRAM
  is available (e.g.\, 1/10th of the disk size). This NVRAM might be used f
 or caching reads\, caching writes\, or storing particular meta-data. Argue
  which use might be most appropriate for improving the performance of LFS.
